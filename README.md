# Motor Control

This repository contains the implementation of PID and PI controllers for motor control.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the synthesis of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Proportional-Integral (PI) controllers, essential for controlling the speed and position of motors.

## Features

- Implementation of PID and PI controllers.
- Examples of motor control applications.
- Well-documented C code for easy understanding and modification.

## Getting Started
